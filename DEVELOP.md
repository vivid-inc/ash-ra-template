# Minimum supported versions

- Lower-bound of Clojure 1.9.0 for [spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec), and because it is compatible with a ``clojure.alpha.tools.deps`` version that has reasonable Maven-style dependency resolution capability.
- Lower-bound of Clojure 1.10.0, farolero's minimum supported version.
- Lower-bound of Java 8, because it strikes a good balance between wide adoption and long-term stability.
